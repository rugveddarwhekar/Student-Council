as the world is advancing into the digital word,  including us in the race with the stepping stone coined as "digital india". and so are we, this site would prove as the digital key to unite the students with digitalization and technology.

the site would provide a single platform to all the students. as we use "google" as the one base to get in touch of every corner, the site would prove to be the same connecting link through out the campus. more the students connect to the website, more easy it would be to access everyone.

And of course stating the obvious, the site would also save a ample amount of time as you would be connected to the site, getting faster updates to all the know hows, the events, seminars, etc in the college. A lifeline to people without whatsapp, hike or any other social media applications. 

The website would turn out to be the break-through for the dawn of "Cybernated Automized GECA". It would be "THE" portal for all the students of the college, and not just students, but even the faculty and staff members. The site would minimize the mannual error drastically. It would be easy to get information about all the activities going on. Also, your personal information won't be leaked. In short, you'll be connected to the whole college at any time through any of your life gadgets.
